# simPLe Compiler

Student: Guilherme Lopes
Number: fc52761

Instructions to run the compiler:
	- The compiler can be run by doing one of the next 3 options:
		1) Executing the "python simple.py \<file\>" command, being the "file" one of those in the "tests" folder
		2) Executing the "python simple.py ok_tests", that runs all the tests that work without errors and all the features developed
		3) Executing the "python simple.py failed_tests", that runs all the tests that fail due to errors which result on mistakes while writing code on the Simple programming language
	- We can also run the run.sh file which runs the compiler with the most complex example in the "tests" folder 

Note: It is necessary to install the dependencies by running the setup.sh file first


Compiler developed and tested in Ubuntu
